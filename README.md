# Computer Vision

This repository is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of computer vision, with a special focus on 3D aspects.
It serves as a resource and guide for those interested in understanding how computers perceive and interpret visual
information from the world around us.

## Core Topics

### Camera Model

We delve into the fundamentals of the camera model, explaining how cameras capture 3D scenes and convert them into 2D
images. This section covers intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, distortion correction, and camera calibration
techniques.

### Multi-View Geometry

Explore the geometry of multiple viewpoints, essential for reconstructing the structure of a scene from different
angles. This includes discussions on the essential and fundamental matrices, stereo vision, and epipolar geometry.

### 3D Reconstruction

Discover methods for reconstructing 3D models of scenes and objects from images. We cover stereo reconstruction,
structure from motion (SfM), and photogrammetry, providing examples and code for creating detailed 3D models.

### Image Features and Matching

Learn about detecting and matching features across images, a critical step for many applications like object recognition
and motion tracking. We explore algorithms like SIFT, ORB, and various feature matching techniques.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Python 3.x:** Most of the projects in this repository are implemented in Python. Make sure you have Python 3.x
  installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

- **Python Libraries:** Several Python libraries are essential for computer vision projects, including NumPy, OpenCV,
  Matplotlib, SciPy, and scikit-image. You can install these using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib scipy scikit-image
